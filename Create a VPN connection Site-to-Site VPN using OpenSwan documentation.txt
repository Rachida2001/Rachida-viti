Create a VPN connection Site-to-Site VPN using OpenSwan documentation.

 To establish a site-to-site VPN connection between your personal AWS account and the organization's account using OpenSwan as the customer gateway, follow these steps:


Prerequisites:

Access to both personal and organization AWS accounts.

Permission to create and configure VPCs, subnets, and VPN connections.

Configuration Steps:

STEP 1 OpenSwan Setup in the organization Account (ON-PREMISES VPC):

Launch a t2.micro instance in your account on a public subnet.

Disable source/destination checks on the EC2.



 

3. The security group set up the Inbound rules:


 

STEP 2 - AWS VPC Configuration

Create VPC and Subnets:

In your account, set up a VPC with a non-overlapping CIDR block compared to the organization's VPC.

Create public and private subnets within this VPC.

2. Create Customer Gateway:

In your account, establish a customer gateway, designating the public IP address of the OpenSwan instance as the gateway's IP.


3. Create Virtual Private Gateway (VGW):

Within the organization's account, generate a virtual private gateway and attach it to the organization's VPC.


4. Set Up Site-to-Site VPN Connection:

Create a site-to-site VPN connection in the organization's account, specifying the customer gateway from your account, and download the VPN configuration as OpenSwan type.


5. Update Route Tables:

In both accounts, update the respective VPCs' route tables to direct traffic to the other VPC through the VPN connection.


6. Install and configure OpenSwan on the instance in the organization Account (ON-PREMISES VPC) by referring to OpenSwan documentation that you download as OpenSwan type in step 6 for installation guidelines. 

SSH into the OpenSwan instance created in the organization Account To install OpenSwan

In the CLI run the command “yum install openswan –y” as a root user.

After that, follow the instructions in the downloaded configuration file and configure Tunnel 1 steps.

run the command systemctl status ipsec to start the IPsec service.

run the command systemctl status ipsec the status command will show you information about whether the service is active, inactive, or encountering any issues.


7. Test Connection:

Verify connectivity by pinging an instance in the organization's VPC from an instance in your account.


Conclusion:

Setting up a site-to-site VPN connection using OpenSwan as the customer gateway between your personal and organization's AWS accounts empowers secure and seamless data transfer across VPCs. This comprehensive guide, detailing step-by-step configurations, ensures a robust and reliable VPN infrastructure. This setup fosters seamless communication and data exchange across VPCs, ensuring a secure network environment for efficient operations.
